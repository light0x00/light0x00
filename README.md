<pre style="font-family: Consolas;font-style:italic;">

Computing is pop culture.
Pop culture holds a disdain for history.
Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating.
It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future-it's living in the present.
I think the same is true of most people who write code for money.
They have no idea where their culture came from.

					Alan Kay, in interview with Dr Dobb's Journal (2012)
