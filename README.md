Computing is pop culture.
Pop culture holds a disdain for history.
Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating.
It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future-it's living in the present.
I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. 
They have no idea where their culture came from.
